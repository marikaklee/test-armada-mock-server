# midway-smocks

Stateful HTTP mocking service built on top of [HAPI](http://hapijs.com/).  Easily add routes and different scenarios for each route including the ability to maintain state with an admin interface to control everything.

This is the forked version of [Smocks](https://github.com/jhudson8/smocks) that will be used for Midway going forward to allow easy modifications and remove dependency.
